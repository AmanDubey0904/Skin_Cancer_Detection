 SKIN_CANCER_DETECTION

 Here I used Kaggle's Skin_Cancer-mnist-ham10000 Dataset to train my CNN model. 
 The link of the dataset is given below-
 :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

 
 On performing data analysisI found the dataset if highly imbalanced so I performed Undersampling to balance it.
 Then I didvide the dataset in train-test-validation sets.
 I created a CNN Model with 6 Convolution layer and 3 maxpooling layer(1 after every 2 convolution layer)
 I trained it on dataset and also calculated confusion matrix .
